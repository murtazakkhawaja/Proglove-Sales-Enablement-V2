SummaryCASE STUDY\nCustomer satisfaction, and the company's brand promise hinge on the \nability to deliver on-time and in-full (OTIF), every single time. Consistency \nhas been a challenge as ASICS has had to deal with rising labor costs, \nturnover, increasing demand, and supply chain issues. In this multichannel \nenvironment, distribution centers support both ASICS stores (B2B) and \nonline orders (B2C). ASICS previously used conventional barcode scanners, \nwhich were heavy and were not designed ergonomically. They also required \nawkward movements for repetitive tasks, which slowed the process and \nincreased the possibility of injury.\nComplete visibility into and control of the scanner fleet was a key concern \nas ASICS also needed to avoid downtime and expenses caused by broken, \nuncharged, or lost devices. Therefore, the company needed a solution that \ncould provide reliable data on the location, condition, and battery status of \nall the scanners.Challenge at ASICS\nASICS operates according to the Japanese Kaizen principle of continuous \nimprovement. Thus, they focuse heavily on the quality of operations, including \nthe distribution centers. There, the focus is on continuously monitoring the \nprocesses in order to continually",

They have learned that the working \nenvironment is an issue central to worker satisfaction. That's why the \ncompany was very interested in finding an ergonomic solution for its \nmany scanning processes. A safer working environment which requires \nless exertion to complete the assigned tasks is much more pleasant and \nattractive, and positively influences word of mouth.Attracting and \nretaining employees\nNeeding an innovative solution to barcode scanning, ASICSS looked to state-of-the-art technology to increase both \nspeed and efficiency. It’s important to understand that their picking process consists of low runners (items that \ndo not have to be picked often) , and high runners which are picked frequently during the day and must be shipped \nquickly.\nThe picking of low runners is therefore fully automated with robots. However, the situation is different for high \nrunners. They have to be picked frequently during the day and shipped quickly. This requires a higher speed than \nthe robots can provide and so is accomplished by the employees because they are much more agile. ProGlove's \nlightweight, wearable scanners are completely hands free, allowing workers to scan goods or packages much faster \nand more ergonomically.

In order for this to happen error-\nfree, the scanners must capture data accurately and reliably.\nProGlove supports ASICS in making the time-consuming processing \nof returns faster and more efficient.

SPAR was particularly successful in Austria, where it further extended its market \nleadership in food retailing with sales revenue of € 8.63 billion (+3.9%). In total, the SPAR Austria Group employs over \n90,000 people. In Austria, SPAR is the largest private Austrian employer with more than 50,000 employees.\nSPAR is also setting new standards in many other areas - for example, in store architecture, product range design, \nlogistics ,and marketing - with the aim of achieving its vision of becoming an Austrian trading company and a Central \nEuropean trading group and taking the SPAR brand even further forward.About SPAR Austria\nIf SPAR is to achieve its plans for growth, it’s logistics and distribution must \nbecome significantly more productive. At five of its nine distribution centers \nin Austria, and most notably at its new central warehouse for fresh products \nin Vorchdorf, SPAR is using ProGlove's wearable scanners to streamline \nthe picking process and provide employees with \"tangible results\" in the \nareas they care most about – the speed, ease, and accuracy of the scanning \nprocess; the reduced chances of injury or error. With the ProGlove wearable \nscanners, employees have their hands free at all times to safely lift goods \nand packages. All barcodes are captured and processed faster than ever \nbefore.

Space, and how that \nspace is used, is a critical success factor in \nlocating, scanning, and picking the right product \nto ship. Often, the worker is on a ladder or \ndriving a forklift, each lifting the worker, but \nleaving them with the same constraints of \nhandheld scanners – weight, repetitive motion, \nand awkward movements. Solution \nHigh, low, or tightly packed, whether on foot, \na ladder, or a forklift, ProGlove’s lightweight, \nergonomic wearable scanners enhance any \nmobility initiative.
