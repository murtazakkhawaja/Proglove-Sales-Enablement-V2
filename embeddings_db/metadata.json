    "text": "The SPAR Austria Group operates food and sports retail stores, and shopping centers in Austria and 7 neighboring \ncountries. They also have a burgeoning e-commerce business. Gross sales of the entire group grew by a total of \n+4.7% to 17.37 billion euros in 2021. SPAR was particularly successful in Austria, where it further extended its market \nleadership in food retailing with sales revenue of € 8.63 billion (+3.9%). In total, the SPAR Austria Group employs over \n90,000 people. In Austria, SPAR is the largest private Austrian employer with more than 50,000 employees.\nSPAR is also setting new standards in many other areas - for example, in store architecture, product range design, \nlogistics ,and marketing - with the aim of achieving its vision of becoming an Austrian trading company and a Central \nEuropean trading group and taking the SPAR brand even further forward.About SPAR Austria\nIf SPAR is to achieve its plans for growth, it’s logistics and distribution must \nbecome significantly more productive. At five of its nine distribution centers \nin Austria, and most notably at its new central warehouse for fresh products \nin Vorchdorf, SPAR is using ProGlove's wearable scanners to streamline \nthe picking process and provide employees with \"tangible results\" in the \nareas they care most about – the speed, ease, and accuracy of the scanning \nprocess; the reduced chances of injury or error. With the ProGlove wearable \nscanners, employees have their hands free at all times to safely lift goods \nand packages. All barcodes are captured and processed faster than ever \nbefore. On the integrated display of the scanners, employees always have \nthe necessary picking instructions in view and are systematically guided \nthrough the process. This minimizes the error rate and contributes overall \nto employee satisfaction and loyalty.SummaryCASE STUDY\nSPAR is facing a number of serious challenges to its growth plans.\n• Customer demand is high and product diversity is increasing. They \nmust maintain, if not increase customer satisfaction\n• Like most retail companies, SPAR is struggling with employee turnover \nand the fact that qualified staff is currently hard to find. \n• However,  logistics must run smoothly and efficiently as a core factor of \na functioning supply chain. \n• Nevertheless, the quality of the picking processes must be maintained \nin order to supply stores and e-commerce customers correctly",

CASE STUDY\nSpeed and quality count\nThe SPAR stores receive their fresh food daily from the warehouse in \nVorchdorf. In the future, deliveries will be made twice a day to guarantee the \nfreshness. This means a high turnover of goods, which requires fast and \nprecise scanning in the warehouse. Currently, 40 employees are working \nin Vorchdorf using around 150 ProGlove scanners. Soon the number of \nemployees will be increased to 80, the target is 120. SPAR Austria organizes its logistics centers by region. ProGlove is used for \nboth in-store supply and e-commerce. Like most retailers, SPAR started to \nexpand e-commerce during the Corona pandemic. The company offers both \nhome delivery and in-store pickup. Employees are tasked with going through \nthe shelves in the supermarket to find and scan the goods the customer has \nordered. ProGlove’s MARK Basic scanners display the customer’s order on \na terminal mounted on the picking cart.

The ongoing competition for qualified \nworkers is fierce. With pay and benefits roughly equal, any improvement \nto the working environment has become a distinct advantage in both \nrecruiting and retaining workers.

In the receiving area, where thousands of books are \nprocessed daily, the ProGlove MARK 3 enabled the team to scan items from \ninside the forklift, eliminating the need for separate handheld scanners. \nThis simplified their daily routine and reduced takt time by up to 8 seconds \nper carton, allowing for faster processing and improved productivity. \nPrioritizing employee safety, Book Depot adopted MARK 3 in their bulk \ninventory management system. This implementation proved to be a game-\nchanger for workers who operated at heights of up to 7.5 meters. The ability \nto scan quickly and reliably from a distance, while freeing both hands, \nempowered operators to remain within the machine's boundaries and \nmaintain focus. As a result, their safety while working at elevated heights \nwas ensured.Use Case 1: \nMARK 3 for forklifts \n& heightsCASE STUDY\nThe shelf picking process underwent a major transformation with the \nintegration of ProGlove's LEO scanner.

The company's mission is to \"Create Quality Lifestyles \nthrough Intelligent Sports Technology\". ASICS is one of the top ten sportswear manufacturers with global sales of \naround 3.1 billion euros (2021). The company operates 1,900 stores worldwide and employs about 8,900 people.About ASICS\nMore than ever, the retail industry needs speed and flexibility to ensure \nsmooth multichannel delivery to customers. To meet the needs of an ever-\nchanging market environment, ASICS is testing and embracing innovative \ntechnologies in its European Distribution Center (EDC) in Germany, and \nits Southern European Distribution Center in France. Every shipment that \nleaves the distribution center must be correct and on time, every single \ntime. Therefore, scanning must be fast and accurate. ASICS has been able \nto optimize its picking and returns processing by making logistics faster, \neasier, and more accurate with ProGlove wearable scanners. SummaryCASE STUDY\nCustomer satisfaction, and the company's brand promise hinge on the \nability to deliver on-time and in-full (OTIF), every single time. Consistency \nhas been a challenge as ASICS has had to deal with rising labor costs, \nturnover, increasing demand, and supply chain issues. In this multichannel \nenvironment, distribution centers support both ASICS stores (B2B) and \nonline orders (B2C). ASICS previously used conventional barcode scanners, \nwhich were heavy and were not designed ergonomically. They also required \nawkward movements for repetitive tasks, which slowed the process and \nincreased the possibility of injury.\nComplete visibility into and control of the scanner fleet was a key concern \nas ASICS also needed to avoid downtime and expenses caused by broken, \nuncharged, or lost devices. Therefore, the company needed a solution that \ncould provide reliable data on the location, condition, and battery status of \nall the scanners.Challenge at ASICS\nASICS operates according to the Japanese Kaizen principle of continuous \nimprovement.

They have learned that the working \nenvironment is an issue central to worker satisfaction.

A safer working environment which requires \nless exertion to complete the assigned tasks is much more pleasant and \nattractive, and positively influences word of mouth.Attracting and \nretaining employees\nNeeding an innovative solution to barcode scanning, ASICSS looked to state-of-the-art technology to increase both \nspeed and efficiency. It’s important to understand that their picking process consists of low runners (items that \ndo not have to be picked often) , and high runners which are picked frequently during the day and must be shipped \nquickly.\nThe picking of low runners is therefore fully automated with robots. However, the situation is different for high \nrunners. They have to be picked frequently during the day and shipped quickly. This requires a higher speed than \nthe robots can provide and so is accomplished by the employees because they are much more agile. ProGlove's \nlightweight, wearable scanners are completely hands free, allowing workers to scan goods or packages much faster \nand more ergonomically.
